                During the development process, various meetings and reviews
                were undertaken. This was to minimise the development turnaround
                time of each functionality. This includes both the frontend and
                the backend code throughout the application. We also diligently
                followed security procedures, which has helped to keep user
                accounts and data transmission between the server and frontend
                secure.
